## The Dark Past
Generally coffee bean supply chains suffer from **lack of transparency**. Customers are wary of supporting illicitly sourced beans, the time of manufacturing, and the process of roasting beans.

## Blockchain Lights the way
Starbucks faced repercussions for the lack of transparency of coffee bean sources. They partnered with MicroSoft to apply blockchain technology to "offer a better experience" to its customers.

Implemented by MicroSoft, each batch of coffee beans had an immutable tag placed on it. This allowed for supply chain participants to trace where each batch. This included information, such as origination, manufacturing date, and the roasting process.
